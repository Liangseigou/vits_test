LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0001.wav|Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0002.wav|in being comparatively modern.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0003.wav|For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0004.wav|produced the block books, which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0005.wav|the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0006.wav|And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0007.wav|the earliest book printed with movable types, the Gutenberg, or "forty-two line Bible" of about fourteen fifty-five
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0008.wav|has never been surpassed.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0009.wav|Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0010.wav|Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0011.wav|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0013.wav|than in the same operations with ugly ones.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0014.wav|And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0015.wav|the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0016.wav|The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0017.wav|that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character, and they followed them very closely.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0018.wav|The first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0019.wav|and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the "lower-case" than the capital letters;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0020.wav|the "lower-case" being in fact invented in the early Middle Ages
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0021.wav|The earliest book printed with movable type, the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible, is printed in letters which are an exact imitation
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0052.wav|yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than Jenson's, and in fact
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0053.wav|they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0054.wav|Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0055.wav|some of which -- as, e.g., that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0056.wav|It was these great Venetian printers, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0057.wav|Parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0058.wav|and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. By far
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0059.wav|the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0060.wav|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0061.wav|the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0062.wav|Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0063.wav|which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0064.wav|many of whose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional character.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0065.wav|This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0066.wav|In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0067.wav|In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0068.wav|The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0069.wav|This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0070.wav|and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0071.wav|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0072.wav|After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0073.wav|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0074.wav|the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0075.wav|the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0076.wav|and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0077.wav|In England about this time, an attempt was made (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in seventeen twenty)
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0078.wav|to improve the letter in form.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0079.wav|Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0080.wav|he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0081.wav|type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0082.wav|In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0083.wav|The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0084.wav|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0085.wav|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0086.wav|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0087.wav|for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0088.wav|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0089.wav|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0090.wav|With this change the art of printing touched bottom
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0091.wav|so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0092.wav|The Chiswick press in eighteen forty-four revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0093.wav|This experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0094.wav|were induced to cut punches for a series of "old style" letters.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0095.wav|These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0096.wav|have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary "modern style" in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0097.wav|a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this modern "old style" leaves a good deal to be desired
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0098.wav|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0099.wav|It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0100.wav|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0101.wav|It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0102.wav|Here and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0103.wav|but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0104.wav|Italy is contentedly stagnant.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0106.wav|oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0107.wav|To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0108.wav|it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0109.wav|this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0110.wav|Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0111.wav|the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0112.wav|instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0113.wav|there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0114.wav|an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0115.wav|in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0116.wav|still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0117.wav|which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0118.wav|In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0119.wav|and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0120.wav|In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0121.wav|in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0122.wav|that he has a five, an eight, or a three before him, unless the press work is of the best:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0123.wav|this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0124.wav|One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0125.wav|this is the narrowing of the modern letters.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0126.wav|Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0127.wav|the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0128.wav|it is not a real gain, for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines, which, probably
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0129.wav|the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0130.wav|Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0131.wav|the size known as "Long primer" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0132.wav|Here, again, if the practice of "leading" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0139.wav|a blemish which can be nearly, though not wholly, avoided by care and forethought
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0140.wav|the desirable thing being "the breaking of the line" as in bonding masonry or brickwork
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0141.wav|The general solidity of a page is much to be sought for
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0142.wav|modern printers generally overdo the "whites" in the spacing, a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0143.wav|For where these are boldly and carefully designed, and each letter is thoroughly individual in form
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0144.wav|the words may be set much closer together, without loss of clearness.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0145.wav|No definite rules, however, except the avoidance of "rivers" and excess of white, can be given for the spacing
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0146.wav|which requires the constant exercise of judgment and taste on the part of the printer.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0147.wav|The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0148.wav|Here once more the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of proportion.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0149.wav|From the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0150.wav|the page so lay on the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin than to the top and back of the paper
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0151.wav|the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0152.wav|The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0153.wav|only nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he uses a headline he counts that in
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0154.wav|the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0155.wav|and that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0156.wav|The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0157.wav|of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0158.wav|it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0159.wav|The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad even in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0160.wav|by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0161.wav|There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0162.wav|even allowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0163.wav|e.g. the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0164.wav|which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0165.wav|One fruitful source of badness in paper
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0166.wav|is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0167.wav|a device which deceives nobody, and makes a book very unpleasant to read.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0168.wav|On the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0169.wav|The paper used for printing the small highly ornamented French service-books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0170.wav|being thin, tough, and opaque.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0171.wav|However, the fact must not be blinked that machine-made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0172.wav|The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on it.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0173.wav|The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0174.wav|should be a part of the whole scheme of the book.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0175.wav|Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0176.wav|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0177.wav|so that if the two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0178.wav|The due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers; so that
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0179.wav|even when the woodcuts are very rude indeed
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0180.wav|the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0181.wav|When, as is most often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0182.wav|the books so ornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0183.wav|Therefore, granted well-designed type, due spacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the paper
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0184.wav|all books might be at least comely and well-looking: and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0185.wav|printed books might once again illustrate to the full
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ001-0186.wav|the position of our Society that a work of utility might be also a work of art, if we cared to make it so.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0001.wav|The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section four: Newgate down to eighteen eighteen.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0002.wav|Under the conditions referred to in the previous chapter
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0003.wav|with criminals and misdemeanants of all shades crowding perpetually into its narrow limits, the latter state of Newgate was worse than the first.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0004.wav|The new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0005.wav|The prison population fluctuated a great deal
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0006.wav|but it was almost always in excess of the accommodation available, and there were times when the place was full to overflowing.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0007.wav|Neild gives some figures which well illustrate this.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0008.wav|On the fourteenth June, eighteen hundred, there were one hundred ninety-nine debtors and two hundred eighty-nine felons in the prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0009.wav|On the twenty-seventh April, in the following year
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0010.wav|these numbers had risen to two hundred seventy-five and three hundred seventy-five respectively, or six hundred fifty in all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0011.wav|For two more years these high figures were steadily maintained, and in eighteen oh three the total rose to seven hundred ten.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0012.wav|After that they fell as steadily
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0013.wav|till, eighteen oh eight, the lowest point was touched of one hundred ninety-seven debtors and one hundred eighty-two felons, or three hundred seventy-nine in all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0014.wav|The numbers soon increased, however, and by eighteen eleven had again risen to six hundred twenty-nine; and Mr. Neild was told that there had been at one time
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0015.wav|three hundred debtors and nine hundred criminals in Newgate, or twelve hundred prisoners in all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0016.wav|Previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently, and once, in Mr. Akerman's time, one thousand.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0017.wav|Trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0018.wav|The inadequacy of the jail was noticed and reported upon again and again by the grand juries of the city of London
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0019.wav|who seldom let a session go by without visiting Newgate.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0020.wav|In eighteen thirteen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0021.wav|the grand jury made a special presentment to the Court of Common Council, pointing out that on the debtors' side, which was intended for only one hundred
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0022.wav|no less than three hundred forty were crowded, to the great inconvenience and danger of the inmates.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0023.wav|On the female side matters were much worse;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0024.wav|Quote. the apartments set apart for them, being built to accommodate sixty persons, now contain about one hundred twenty. End quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0025.wav|Returns laid before the House of Commons showed that six thousand, four hundred thirty-nine persons had been committed to Newgate
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0026.wav|in the three years between eighteen thirteen and eighteen sixteen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0027.wav|and this number did not include the debtors, a numerous class, who were still committed to Newgate pending the completion of the White Cross Street prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0028.wav|In order to realize the evils entailed by incarceration in Newgate in these days, it is necessary to give some account of its interior
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0029.wav|as it was occupied and appropriated in eighteen ten.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0040.wav|intended to accommodate a couple of prisoners apiece, but often much more crowded.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0041.wav|Two other wards were appropriated to the master's side debtors; they were each twenty-three feet by fourteen and a half
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0042.wav|and supposed to accommodate twenty persons. The eight remaining wards were for the common side debtors
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0043.wav|long narrow rooms -- one thirty-six feet, six twenty-three feet, and the eighth eighteen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0044.wav|the whole about fifteen feet wide.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0045.wav|The various wards were all about eleven feet in height
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0046.wav|and were occupied as a rule by ten to fifteen people when the prison was not crowded, but double the number was occasionally placed in them.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0047.wav|The day room was fitted with benches and settles after the manner of the tap in a public-house.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0048.wav|two. The female debtors' side consisted of a court-yard forty-nine by sixteen feet
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0049.wav|leading to two wards, one of which was thirty-six feet by fifteen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0050.wav|and the other eighteen by fifteen; and they nominally held twenty-two persons.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0051.wav|A high wall fifteen feet in height divided the females' court-yard from the men's.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0052.wav|three. The chapel yard was about forty-three feet by twenty-five.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0053.wav|It had been for some time devoted principally to felons of the worst types
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0054.wav|those who were the oldest offenders, sentenced to transportation, and who had narrowly escaped the penalty of death.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0055.wav|This arrangement was, however, modified after eighteen eleven, and the chapel yard was allotted to misdemeanants and prisoners awaiting trial.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0056.wav|The wards in this part were five in number, all in dimensions twenty feet by fifteen, with a sixth ward fifteen feet square.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0057.wav|These wards were all fitted with barrack-beds, but no bedding was supplied.

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0060.wav|But these king's witnesses were also put at times into the press yard among the capital convicts, seemingly a very dangerous proceeding
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0061.wav|or they lodged with the gatesmen, the prisoner officers who had charge of the inner gates.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0062.wav|The middle yard was at first given up to the least heinous offenders. After eighteen twelve it changed functions with the chapel yard.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0063.wav|It was fifty feet by twenty-five, and had five wards each thirty-eight by fifteen. At one end of the yard was an arcade
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0064.wav|directly under the chapel, in which there were three cells, used either for the confinement of disorderly and refractory prisoners
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0065.wav|or female convicts ordered for execution.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0066.wav|The master felons' side consisted of a yard the same size as the preceding, appropriated nominally to the most decent and better-behaved prisoners
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0067.wav|but really kept for the few who had funds sufficient to gain them admission to these more comfortable quarters.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0068.wav|Here were also lodged the gatesmen, the prisoners who had charge of the inner gates, and who were entrusted with the duty of escorting visitors from the gates
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0069.wav|to the various wards their friends occupied.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0070.wav|The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0071.wav|It was large and comparatively commodious, being maintained on a better footing than any other part of the prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0072.wav|The inmates were privileged, either by antecedents or the fortunate possession of sufficient funds to pay the charges of the place.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0073.wav|Neild takes it for granted that the former rather than the latter prevailed in the selection

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0076.wav|The state side contained twelve good-sized rooms
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0077.wav|from twenty-one by eighteen feet to fifteen feet square, which were furnished with bedsteads and bedding.

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0082.wav|Beyond the press yard were three stories, condemned cells, fifteen in all, with vaulted ceilings nine feet high to the crown of the arch.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0083.wav|The ground floor cells were nine feet by six;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0084.wav|those on the first floor were rather larger on account of a set-off in the wall; and the uppermost were the largest, for the same reason.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0085.wav|Security was provided for in these condemned cells by lining the substantial stone walls with planks studded with broad-headed nails;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0086.wav|they were lighted by a double-grated window two feet nine inches by fourteen inches; and in the doors, which were four inches thick
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0087.wav|a circular aperture had been let in to give ventilation and secure a free current of air.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0088.wav|In each cell there was a barrack bedstead on the floor without bedding.

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0236.wav|Matters were rather better at the Marshalsea.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0237.wav|This very ancient prison, which stood in the High Street, Southwark
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0238.wav|was used for debtors arrested for the lowest sums within twelve miles of the palace of Whitehall;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0239.wav|also for prisoners committed by the Admiralty Court.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0240.wav|At one time the Marshalsea was the receptacle of pirates, but none were committed to it after seventeen eighty-nine.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0241.wav|The court of the Marshalsea was instituted by Charles the first in the sixth year of his reign
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0242.wav|to be held before the steward of the royal household, the knight marshal, and the steward of the court
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0243.wav|with jurisdiction to hold pleas in all actions within the prescribed limits. The court was chiefly used for the recovery of small debts under ten pounds
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0244.wav|but its business was much reduced by the extension of the Courts of Conscience.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0245.wav|The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0246.wav|and came under the strong animadversion of the Jail Committee of seventeen twenty-nine.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0247.wav|As the business of the Marshalsea Court declined, the numbers in its prison diminished.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0248.wav|The population, as reported by the committee in eighteen fourteen, averaged about sixty
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0249.wav|and the prison, although wives and children resided within the walls, was not overcrowded.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0250.wav|Their conduct too was orderly on the whole.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0251.wav|Drunkenness was not common, chiefly because liquor was not to be had freely, although the tapster paid a rent of two guineas a week for permission to sell it.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0255.wav|A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0256.wav|A committee of collegians was elected to act as the executive, also a secretary or accountant to receive monies and keep books
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0257.wav|and a master of the ale-room, who kept this the scene of their revels clean, and saw that boiling water was provided for grog.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0258.wav|Bad language, quarreling, throwing water over one another was forbidden on pain of fine and being sent to Coventry;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0259.wav|but the prevailing moral tone may be guessed from the penalty inflicted upon persons singing obscene songs before nine p.m.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0260.wav|Yet the public opinion of the whole body seems to have checked dissipation.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0261.wav|The poorer prisoners were not in abject want, as in other prisons
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0262.wav|owing to many charitable gifts and bequests, which included annual donations from the Archbishop of Canterbury

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0264.wav|Legacies had also been left to free a certain number of debtors, notably that of one hundred pounds per annum
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0265.wav|left by a Mr. Henry Allnutt, who was long a prisoner in the Marshalsea, and came into a fortune while there.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0266.wav|His bequest, which was charged upon his manor at Goring, Oxon, and hence called the Oxford Charity
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0267.wav|was applied only to the release of poor debtors whom four pounds each could free.

LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0269.wav|he did nothing beyond visiting the prison occasionally, and left the administration to the deputy marshal.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0270.wav|The latter's salary, with fees, the rent of the tap and of the chandler's shop, amounted to about six hundred pounds a year.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0271.wav|The compters of Ludgate, Giltspur Street, and the Borough were discontinued as debtors' prisons (as was Newgate also)
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0272.wav|on the opening of Whitecross prison for debtors in eighteen fifteen.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0273.wav|Ludgate to the last was the debtors' prison for freemen of the city of London
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0274.wav|clergymen, proctors, attorneys, and persons specially selected by the Corporation.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0275.wav|At one time the Ludgate debtors, accompanied by the keeper
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0276.wav|went outside and beyond the prison to call on their creditors, and try to arrange their debts, but this practice was discontinued.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0277.wav|There were fifteen rooms of various sizes, and as the numbers imprisoned rarely exceeded five-and-twenty, the place was never overcrowded
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0278.wav|while the funds of several bequests and charities were applied in adding to the material comfort of the prisoners.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0279.wav|The Giltspur Street Compter received sheriffs' debtors, also felons, vagrants, and night charges.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0280.wav|It was generally crowded, as debtors who would have gone to the Poultry Compter were sent to Giltspur Street when the former was condemned as unfit to receive prisoners.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0281.wav|The demands for fees were excessive in Giltspur Street.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ002-0282.wav|Those who could not pay were thrown into the wards with the night charges
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0016.wav|Bad cases were removed to a cell on the felons' side, and here they were locked in solitary confinement for three days at a time.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0017.wav|Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0018.wav|and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0019.wav|and which was never wholly rooted out for many years to come.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0020.wav|This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0021.wav|The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0022.wav|This steward was practically supreme.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0023.wav|All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0024.wav|he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0025.wav|In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0026.wav|The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0027.wav|He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0028.wav|and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0029.wav|Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0030.wav|These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0031.wav|The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0032.wav|So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0033.wav|Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0034.wav|This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0035.wav|and about eighteen twelve application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0036.wav|Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of ninety thousand pounds.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0037.wav|A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0038.wav|which would accommodate the inmates of Newgate and of the three compters, Ludgate
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0039.wav|Giltspur Street, and the Poultry, or about four hundred and seventy-six in all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0040.wav|The evils of association for these debtors were perpetuated, although the plan provided for the separation of the various contingents committed to it.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0041.wav|There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0042.wav|The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0043.wav|and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in eighteen fifteen.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0044.wav|The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0045.wav|more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0046.wav|could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0047.wav|Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0048.wav|I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0049.wav|The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0050.wav|(one) those awaiting trial;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0051.wav|(two) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0052.wav|(three) transports awaiting removal to the colonies, and (four) capital convicts, condemned to death and awaiting execution.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0053.wav|At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0054.wav|An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0055.wav|or class (one), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (two).
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0056.wav|This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0057.wav|A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0058.wav|but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0059.wav|The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0060.wav|which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0061.wav|No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0062.wav|When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0063.wav|but when the ward was obliged to accommodate double the ordinary number, as was frequently the case
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0064.wav|the sleepers covered the entire floor, with the exception of a passage in the middle.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0065.wav|All the misdemeanants, whatever their offense, were lodged in this chapel ward.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0066.wav|As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0067.wav|in the then existing state of the law
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0068.wav|the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent, or others who had attempted abominable crimes.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0069.wav|In this heterogeneous society were also thrown the unfortunate journalists to whom I have already referred, and on whom imprisonment in Newgate
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0070.wav|was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0071.wav|It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in eighteen fourteen
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0072.wav|that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0073.wav|Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0074.wav|The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in eighteen seventeen, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0075.wav|thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0076.wav|four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0077.wav|Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0078.wav|Nor were the misdemeanants and bail prisoners any longer separated from those whose crimes were of a more serious character.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0079.wav|Mr. Bennet refers to a gentleman confined for want of bail, who occupied a room with five others
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0080.wav|two committed by the Bankruptcy Commissioner, one for perjury, and two transports.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0081.wav|Persons convicted of publishing libels were still immured in the same rooms with transports and felons.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0082.wav|The middle yard, as far as its limits would permit, was appropriated to felons and transports. The wards here were generally very crowded.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0083.wav|Each ward was calculated to hold twenty-four, allowing each individual one foot and a half;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0085.wav|These twenty-four could just sleep on the barrack bed; when the number was higher, and it often rose to forty, the surplus had to sleep on the floor.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0086.wav|The crowding was in consequence of the delay in removing transports.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0087.wav|These often remained in Newgate for six months, sometimes a year, in some cases longer;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0088.wav|in one, for seven years -- that of a man sentenced to death, for whom great interest had been made, but whom it was not thought right to pardon.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0089.wav|Occasionally the transports made themselves so useful in the jail that they were passed over.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0090.wav|Mr. Newman admitted that he had petitioned that certain "trusty men" might be left in the jail.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0091.wav|Constantly associated with these convicted felons were numbers of juveniles, infants of tender years.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0092.wav|There were frequently in the middle yard seven or eight children, the youngest barely nine
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0093.wav|the oldest only twelve or thirteen, exposed to all the contaminating influences of the place.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0094.wav|Mr. Bennet mentions also the case of young men of better stamp, clerks in city offices, and youths of good parentage
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0095.wav|Quote, in this dreadful situation, end quote. who had been rescued from the hulks through the kindness and attention of the Secretary of State.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0096.wav|Quote, yet they had been long enough, he goes on to say, in the prison associated with the lowest and vilest criminals
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0097.wav|with convicts of all ages and characters, to render it next to impossible but that, with the obliteration of all sense of self-respect
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0098.wav|the inevitable consequence of such a situation, their morals must have been destroyed;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0099.wav|and though distress or the seduction of others might have led to the commission of this their first offense
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0100.wav|yet the society they were driven to live in, the language they daily heard, and the lessons they were taught in this academy
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0101.wav|must have had a tendency to turn them into the world hardened and accomplished in the ways of vice and crime. End quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0102.wav|Mr. Buxton, in the work already quoted, instances another grievous case of the horrors of indiscriminate association in Newgate.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0103.wav|It was that of a person, quote, who practiced in the law, and who was connected by marriage with some very respectable families.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0104.wav|Having been committed to Clerkenwell
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0105.wav|he was sent on to Newgate in a coach, handcuffed to a noted house-breaker, who was afterwards cast for death.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0106.wav|The first night in Newgate, and for the subsequent fortnight
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0107.wav|he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side, and a man charged with murder on the other.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0108.wav|Spirits were freely introduced, and although he at first abstained
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0109.wav|he found he must adopt the manners of his companions, or that his life would be in danger.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0110.wav|They viewed him with some suspicion, as one of whom they knew nothing.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0111.wav|He was in consequence put out of the protection of their internal law, end quote. Their code was a subject of some curiosity.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0112.wav|When any prisoner committed an offense against the community or against an individual, he was tried by a court in the jail.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0113.wav|A prisoner, generally the oldest and most dexterous thief
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0114.wav|was appointed judge, and a towel tied in knots was hung on each side in imitation of a wig.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0115.wav|The judge sat in proper form; he was punctiliously styled "my lord."
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0116.wav|A jury having been selected and duly sworn, the culprit was then arraigned. Justice, however, was not administered with absolute integrity.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0117.wav|A bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal, and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0118.wav|Various punishments were inflicted, the heaviest of which was standing in the pillory.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0119.wav|This was carried out by putting the criminal's head through the legs of a chair, and stretching out his arms and tying them to the legs.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0120.wav|The culprit was then compelled to carry the chair about with him.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0121.wav|But all punishments might readily be commuted into a fine to be spent in gin for judge and jury.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0122.wav|The prisoner mentioned above was continually persecuted by trials of this kind.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0123.wav|The most trifling acts were magnified into offenses.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0124.wav|He was charged with moving something which should not be touched, with leaving a door open, or coughing maliciously to the disturbance of his companions.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0125.wav|The evidence was invariably sufficient to convict, and the judge never hesitated to inflict the heaviest penalties.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0126.wav|The unfortunate man was compelled at length to adopt the habits of his associates;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0127.wav|Quote, by insensible degrees he began to lose his repugnance to their society
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0128.wav|caught their flash terms and sung their songs, was admitted to their revels, and acquired, in place of habits of perfect sobriety
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0129.wav|a taste for spirits. End quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0130.wav|His wife visited him in Newgate, and wrote a pitiable account of the state in which she found her husband.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0131.wav|He was an inmate of the same ward with others of the most dreadful sort, quote
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0132.wav|whose language and manners, whose female associates of the most abandoned description, and the scenes consequent with such lost wretches
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0133.wav|prevented me from going inside but seldom, and I used to communicate with him through the bars from the passage. End quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0134.wav|One day he was too ill to come down and meet her.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0135.wav|She went up to the ward and found him lying down, quote
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0136.wav|pale as death, very ill, and in a dreadfully dirty state, the wretches making game of him, and enjoying my distress;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0137.wav|and I learned he had been up with the others the whole night.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0138.wav|Though they could not force him to gamble, he was compelled to drink
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0139.wav|and I was obliged afterwards to let him have five shillings to pay his share
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0140.wav|otherwise he would have been stripped of his clothes. End quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0141.wav|Felons who could pay the price were permitted, irrespective of their character or offenses
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0142.wav|to purchase the greater ease and comfort of the master's side.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0143.wav|The entrance fee was at least thirteen shillings, six pence a head, with half-a-crown a week more for bed and bedding
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0144.wav|the wards being furnished with barrack bedsteads, upon which each prisoner had the regulation allowance of sleeping room
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0145.wav|or about a foot and a half laterally. These fees were in reality a substantial contribution towards the expenses of the jail;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0146.wav|without them the keeper declared that he could not pay the salaries of turnkeys and servants, nor keep the prison going at all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0147.wav|Besides the jail fees, there was garnish of half-a-guinea, collected by the steward
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0148.wav|and spent in providing coals, candles, plates, knives, and forks; while all the occupants of this part of the prison
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0149.wav|supported themselves; they had the ration of prison bread only
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0150.wav|but they had no share in the prison meat or other charities, and they or their friends found them in food.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0151.wav|All who could scrape together the cash seem to have gladly availed themselves of the privilege of entering the master's side.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0152.wav|It was the only way to escape the horrors, the distress, penury, and rags of the common yards.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0153.wav|Idleness was not so universally the rule in this part of the jail.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0154.wav|Artisans and others were at liberty to work at their trades, provided they were not dangerous.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0155.wav|Tailoring and shoemaking was permitted, but it was deemed unsafe to allow a carpenter or blacksmith to have his tools.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0156.wav|All the money earned by prisoners was at their own disposal, and was spent almost habitually in drink, chambering, and wantonness.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0157.wav|The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0158.wav|from whom still higher fees were exacted, with the same discreditable idea of swelling the revenues of the prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0159.wav|To constitute this the aristocratic quarter, unwarrantable demands were made upon the space properly allotted to the female felons
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0160.wav|and no lodger was rejected, whatever his status, who offered himself and could bring grist to the mill.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0161.wav|The luxury of the state side was for a long time open to all who could pay
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0162.wav|the convicted felon, the transport awaiting removal, the lunatic whose case was still undecided
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0163.wav|the misdemeanant tried or untried, the debtor who wished to avoid the discomfort of the crowded debtors' side, the outspoken newspaper editor
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0164.wav|or the daring reporter of parliamentary debates.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0165.wav|The better class of inmate complained bitterly of this enforced companionship with the vile
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0166.wav|association at one time forbidden by custom, but which greed and rapacity long made the rule.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0167.wav|The fee for admission to the state side, as fixed by the table of fees, was three guineas, but Mr. Newman declared that he never took more than two.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0168.wav|Ten and sixpence a week more was charged as rent for a single bed; where two or more slept in a bed the rent was seven shillings a week each.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0169.wav|Prisoners who could afford it sometimes paid for four beds, at the rate of twenty-eight shillings, and so secured the luxury of a private room.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0170.wav|A Mr. Lundy, charged with forgery, was thus accommodated on the state side for upwards of five years.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0171.wav|But the keeper protested that no single prisoner could thus monopolize space if the state side was crowded.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0172.wav|The keeper went still further in his efforts to make money.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0173.wav|He continued the ancient practice of letting out a portion of his own house, and by a poetical fiction treated it as an annex of the state side.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0174.wav|Mr. Davison, sent to Newgate for embezzlement, and whose case is given in the preceding chapter
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0175.wav|was accommodated with a room in Mr. Newman's house at the extravagant rental of thirty guineas per week;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0176.wav|Mr. Cobbett was also a lodger of Mr. Newman's; and so were any members of the aristocracy
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0177.wav|if they happened to be in funds -- among whom was the Marquis of Sligo in eighteen eleven.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0178.wav|The female felons' wards I shall describe at length in the next chapter
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0179.wav|which will deal with Mrs. Fry's philanthropic exertions at this period in this particular part of the prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0180.wav|These wards were always full to overflowing; sometimes double the number the rooms could accommodate were crowded into them.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0181.wav|There was a master's side for females who could pay the usual fees, but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0182.wav|The tried and the untried, young and old, were herded together
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0183.wav|sometimes girls of thirteen, twelve, even ten or nine years of age, were exposed to, quote
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0184.wav|all the contagion and profligacy which prevailed in this part of the prison, end quote.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0185.wav|There was no separation even for the women under sentence of death, who lived in a common and perpetually crowded ward.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0186.wav|Only when the order of execution came down were those about to suffer placed apart in one of the rooms in the arcade of the middle ward.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0187.wav|I have kept till the last that part of the prison which was usually the last resting-place of so many.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0188.wav|The old press yard has been fully described in a previous chapter.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0189.wav|The name still survived in the new press yard, which was the receptacle of the male condemned prisoners. It was generally crowded, like the rest of the prison.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0190.wav|Except in murder cases, where the execution was generally very promptly performed
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0191.wav|strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0192.wav|Hence there was a terrible accumulation of prisoners in the condemned cells.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0245.wav|preparatory to their appearance in the Old Bailey. Irons were seldom removed from the convicted until discharge;
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0246.wav|sometimes the wearer was declared medically unfit, or he obtained release by long good conduct
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0247.wav|or the faithful discharge of some petty office, such as gatesman or captain of a ward.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0248.wav|The irons weighed from three to four pounds, but heavier irons, seven or eight pounds' weight
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0249.wav|were imposed in case of misconduct; and when there had been an attempt at escape
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0250.wav|the culprit was chained down to the floor by running a chain through his irons which prevented him from climbing to the window of his cell.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0251.wav|Among other excuses offered for thus manacling all almost without exception, was that it was the best and safest method
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0252.wav|of distinguishing a prisoner from a stranger and temporary visitor.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0253.wav|Clothes or prison uniform would not have served the purpose, for a disguise can be rapidly and secretly put on
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0254.wav|whereas irons cannot well be exchanged without loss of time and attracting much attention.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0255.wav|The unchecked admission of crowds of visitors to the felons' as well as the debtors' side was another unmixed evil.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0256.wav|By this means spirits, otherwise unattainable and strictly prohibited, were smuggled into the jail.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0257.wav|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0258.wav|Hence the frequent cases of drunkenness, of which no notice was taken, unless people grew riotous in their cups
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0259.wav|and attracted attention by their disorderly behavior.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0275.wav|These malpractices were fostered by the absence of all supervision and the generally unbroken idleness.
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0276.wav|Although attempted partially at Bridewell, and more systematically at the new Millbank penitentiary
LJSpeech/DUMMY1/LJ003-0278.wav|Insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades.
